### 📜 Problem Description

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:**  The input/output format is the same as  [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/32442719377939-How-to-create-test-cases-on-LeetCode#h_01J5EGREAW3NAEJ14XC07GRW1A) . You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Example 1:**

 ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg) 

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []

```

**Constraints:**

	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[0, 104]` .
	
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
