### 📜 Problem Description

You are given an integer array  `nums` . You are initially positioned at the array's  **first index** , and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return  `true`  *if you can reach the last index, or*  `false`  *otherwise* .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

```

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
	
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`
