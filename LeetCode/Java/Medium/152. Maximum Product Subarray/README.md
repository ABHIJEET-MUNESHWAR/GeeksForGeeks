### 📜 Problem Description

Given an integer array  `nums` , find a subarray that has the largest product, and return  *the product* .

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a  **32-bit**  integer.

**Note**  that the product of an array with a single element is the value of that element.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

```

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
	
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
	
- The product of any subarray of  `nums`  is  **guaranteed**  to fit in a  **32-bit**  integer.
