### 📜 Problem Description

Given an  `n x n`  binary matrix  `grid` , return  *the length of the shortest  **clear path**  in the matrix* . If there is no clear path, return  `-1` .

A  **clear path**  in a binary matrix is a path from the  **top-left**  cell (i.e.,  `(0, 0)` ) to the  **bottom-right**  cell (i.e.,  `(n - 1, n - 1)` ) such that:

	
- All the visited cells of the path are  `0` .
	
- All the adjacent cells of the path are  **8-directionally**  connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).

The  **length of a clear path**  is the number of visited cells of this path.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2

```

**Example 2:**

 ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/example2_1.png) 

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: 4

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: -1

```

**Constraints:**

	
- `n == grid.length`
	
- `n == grid[i].length`
	
- `1 <= n <= 100`
	
- `grid[i][j] is 0 or 1`
