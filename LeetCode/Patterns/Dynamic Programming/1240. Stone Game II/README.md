### 📜 Problem Description

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles  **arranged in a row** , and each pile has a positive integer number of stones  `piles[i]` . The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.

On each player's turn, that player can take  **all the stones**  in the  **first**   `X`  remaining piles, where  `1 <= X <= 2M` . Then, we set  `M = max(M, X)` . Initially, M = 1.

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  piles = [2,7,9,4,4]

**Output:**  10

**Explanation:**

	
- If Alice takes one pile at the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can get  `2 + 4 + 4 = 10`  stones in total.
	
- If Alice takes two piles at the beginning, then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get  `2 + 7 = 9`  stones in total.

So we return 10 since it's larger.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  piles = [1,2,3,4,5,100]

**Output:**  104

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= piles.length <= 100`
	
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 104`
