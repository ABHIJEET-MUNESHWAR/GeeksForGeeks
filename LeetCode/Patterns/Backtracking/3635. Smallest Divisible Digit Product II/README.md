### 📜 Problem Description

You are given a string  `num`  which represents a  **positive**  integer, and an integer  `t` .

A number is called  **zero-free**  if  *none*  of its digits are 0.

Return a string representing the  **smallest**   **zero-free**  number greater than or equal to  `num`  such that the  **product of its digits**  is divisible by  `t` . If no such number exists, return  `"-1"` .

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  num = "1234", t = 256

**Output:**  "1488"

**Explanation:**

The smallest zero-free number that is greater than 1234 and has the product of its digits divisible by 256 is 1488, with the product of its digits equal to 256.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  num = "12355", t = 50

**Output:**  "12355"

**Explanation:**

12355 is already zero-free and has the product of its digits divisible by 50, with the product of its digits equal to 150.

**Example 3:**

**Input:**  num = "11111", t = 26

**Output:**  "-1"

**Explanation:**

No number greater than 11111 has the product of its digits divisible by 26.

**Constraints:**

	
- `2 <= num.length <= 2 * 105`
	
- `num`  consists only of digits in the range  `['0', '9']` .
	
- `num`  does not contain leading zeros.
	
- `1 <= t <= 1014`
