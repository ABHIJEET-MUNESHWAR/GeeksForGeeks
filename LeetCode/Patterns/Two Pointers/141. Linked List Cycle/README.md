### 📜 Problem Description

Given  `head` , the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the  `next`  pointer. Internally,  `pos`  is used to denote the index of the node that tail's  `next`  pointer is connected to.  **Note that  `pos`  is not passed as a parameter** .

Return  `true`  *if there is a cycle in the linked list* . Otherwise, return  `false` .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

```

**Example 2:**

 ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png) 

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

```

**Example 3:**

 ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png) 

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

```

**Constraints:**

	
- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range  `[0, 104]` .
	
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
	
- `pos`  is  `-1`  or a  **valid index**  in the linked-list.

**Follow up:**  Can you solve it using  `O(1)`  (i.e. constant) memory?
