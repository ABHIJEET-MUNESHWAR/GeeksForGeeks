1) The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^l-1.
2) The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2^h – 1.
3) In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is  ⌈ Log2(N+1) ⌉
4) A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least   ⌈ Log2L ⌉ + 1   levels
5) In Binary tree, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.
6) Full Binary Tree:
    A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children. Following are examples of full binary tree.
7) In a Full Binary, number of leaf nodes is number of internal nodes plus 1
8) Complete Binary Tree:
    A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible
9) Perfect Binary Tree:
    A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at same level.
10) In a k-ary tree where every node has either 0 or k children, following property is always true.
L = (k - 1)*I + 1
Where L = Number of leaf nodes
      I = Number of internal nodes
